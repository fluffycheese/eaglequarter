## Eagle Quarter Newbury – Planning Permission

The redevelopment of Newbury’s town centre at the Kennet Shopping Centre, known as Eagle Quarter, has seen a complex planning history. A major planning application for an eight-storey, mixed-use redevelopment was submitted and subsequently refused by West Berkshire Council due to concerns about its scale and impacts on the town’s character and heritage. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

After the refusal, the developer appealed the decision. However, a Government planning inspector also dismissed the appeal, concluding that the design and massing would be overly dominant and not in keeping with the historic townscape. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

The refusal and subsequent appeal decision have led to further redevelopment proposals for the site, including alternative plans that aim to better integrate with Newbury’s conservation area and local planning policies. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Current Status

As of the latest updates, the previously rejected Eagle Quarter plans remain refused, and stakeholders including West Berkshire Council, the Newbury Society, and local planning bodies continue discussions about future proposals. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
