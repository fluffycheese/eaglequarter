# Eagle Quarter Newbury Development Tracker

This page provides an up-to-date overview of the **Eagle Quarter** redevelopment, centred on the former **Kennet Centre** site in Newbury, Berkshire. It tracks planning status, development proposals, demolition progress and key scheme elements.

---

## Current Planning Status

As of early 2026, a **revised planning application (ref 25/00391/FULMAJ)** was being considered by West Berkshire Council. Officers recommended planning permission be **granted subject to a Section 106 Agreement** and conditions, for partial demolition of the existing Kennet Centre and redevelopment of the site.

Demolition preparation and clearance of the old shopping centre buildings has been reported as underway as part of broader site preparation.

_Planning permission has not yet been fully confirmed by an official decision notice available in the public record._

## Proposed Development Details

The latest scheme considered by the planning committee would include:

**Residential**
- Approx. **317 new homes**, including a mix of private sale and Build-to-Rent units.
- The residential elements were designed to replace most of the existing commercial structure on the site.

**Commercial / Retail**
- New **flexible Class E commercial units** at street level fronting Bartholomew Street and Market Place.
- Refurbished commercial space integrated with the retained Vue Cinema block.
- Combined new and refurbished commercial space totalling over **5,200 sqm**.

**Site Works**
- Partial demolition of the existing Kennet Centre structures.
- Retention of the multi-storey car park and Vue Cinema, with internal reconfiguration.

## Demolition and Site Preparation

Local reporting and community updates indicate that the **Kennet Centre has been boarded up and demolition preparation work is in progress**, with clearance expected to take several months prior to the start of main construction works.

## Why This Matters

The redevelopment of the Kennet Centre as Eagle Quarter seeks to transform a long-declining town-centre shopping site into a new residential and commercial neighbourhood. Delivering new homes in a central, sustainable location supports housing supply in West Berkshire. The mix of uses also aims to reinvigorate Newbury’s high street and improve pedestrian connectivity.
