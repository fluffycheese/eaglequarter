## Eagle Quarter Newbury – Location & Connectivity
The site commonly referred to as Eagle Quarter is located in central Newbury within the West Berkshire district, centred on the ageing Kennet Shopping Centre. Newbury is a historic market town in Berkshire with strong regional links via road and rail.
### Strategic Position
Newbury benefits from direct access to the A339 and A4 road corridors, and Newbury railway station provides regular services towards Reading, London Paddington and other destinations. This connectivity underscores the potential of town-centre redevelopment to attract residents, businesses, and visitors.
### Urban Context
The Eagle Quarter/Old Town site sits within the Newbury Town Centre Conservation Area, characterised by a mix of historic streets, listed buildings, and civic spaces. This urban setting has shaped planning discussions regarding the scale and design of redevelopment proposals.
### Local Amenities
Newbury town centre offers retail, dining, cultural, and leisure amenities, including on Northbrook Street, Parkway Shopping Centre, and nearby public parks. Enhancing the connection between the redevelopment site and these amenities has been a recurring theme in planning and investment discourse.
