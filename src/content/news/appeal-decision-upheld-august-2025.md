The Planning Inspectorate has upheld the earlier refusal of the mixed-use Eagle Quarter redevelopment proposals for the Kennet Centre in Newbury, concluding that the scheme would not integrate appropriately with the historic town centre and conservation area. Inspector R. Aston cited concerns over scale, building mass and impact on listed buildings as key reasons for the dismissal.

Local supporters of heritage and townscape protection welcomed the decision, saying it reinforces the importance of sensitive, context-aware urban development in historic centres.
