The Newbury Society has released a statement welcoming the planning inspector’s decision to uphold the refusal of the Eagle Quarter redevelopment proposal, highlighting concerns that the proposed buildings would have been overly dominant and out of character with the historic townscape.

The Society reiterated its position that redevelopment should enhance Newbury’s architectural character, support affordable housing and respect the setting of heritage assets, while cautioning against proposals that overwhelm the historic urban grain.
