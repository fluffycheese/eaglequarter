West Berkshire Council has granted planning permission for a revised redevelopment scheme on the Kennet Shopping Centre site that replaces the earlier Eagle Quarter proposals. The scheme includes partial demolition of the existing centre and new residential units with associated commercial space, landscaping, and improvements to public realm.

The permission follows extensive revisions aimed at addressing concerns about heritage impact and scale, and reflects a new approach under the ‘Old Town Newbury’ branding.

Project supporters say that, while challenges remain, the updated plans promise better integration with the town’s historic character and could mark a turning point for long-debated regeneration.
