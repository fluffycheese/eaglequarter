West Berkshire Council has granted planning permission for a revised redevelopment of Newbury’s ageing Kennet Shopping Centre site after earlier Eagle Quarter proposals were dismissed by a planning inspector.

The approved “Old Town” plan will include 107 houses and 210 flats, significantly reducing the retail footprint from approximately 14,900 sqm to 5,200 sqm and reconfiguring space to better align with the town’s character.

Councillors on the council’s western area planning committee described the decision as a “huge step forward”, despite concerns over building scale on Market Street and Cheap Street. Newbury Town Council also backed the scheme as a clearer improvement over the earlier Eagle Quarter scheme, which envisioned around 420 homes.

Critics pointed to a lack of affordable housing and parking concerns, with planning officers noting viability issues for incorporating additional affordable units. Nevertheless, the project includes five new commercial units fronting Bartholomew Street and Market Place to enhance local economic activity.

The move signals a new phase for central Newbury’s urban landscape, with redevelopment seen as vital to revitalising a struggling town-centre asset while attempting to retain local character.
