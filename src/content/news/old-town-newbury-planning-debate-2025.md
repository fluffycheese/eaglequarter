A revised proposal for redeveloping the Kennet Centre site under the banner “Old Town Newbury” has been the subject of local planning discussion, with proponents saying the new design better reflects local heritage and scale than previous Eagle Quarter schemes.

The scheme proposes 317 residential units in a layout that seeks to respect the traditional street pattern and improve integration with the surrounding conservation area, though some concerns remain among heritage groups and councillors.
