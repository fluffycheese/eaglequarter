I live just a five-minute walk from the redevelopment site at the heart of Newbury, and I work locally. I’ve always valued the character of Newbury — its independent shops, cafes and restaurants — and watched its evolution with a mix of optimism and concern. When the opportunity came to register [**eaglequarter.co.uk**](https://eaglequarter.co.uk), I saw a chance to create something that serves both local residents *and* the broader community with clear, factual information about this major redevelopment initiative.

This site is not about speculation or sensationalism. It’s about providing **independent, well-sourced updates** on planning decisions, community responses, and broader economic and heritage considerations.

From an economic perspective, the redevelopment affects many stakeholders: local shopkeepers worried about footfall during construction, landlords adapting to changing retail patterns, and potential new residents considering whether to make Newbury home. Historically, places like the Kennet Centre carried memories of past shopping experiences, community jobs and social spaces that aren’t easily replaced.

There are pros and cons. On one hand, thoughtful redevelopment can rejuvenate neglected sites, attract investment and modernise under-used spaces. On the other, large schemes risk undermining the **historic character** that makes Newbury distinctive. As someone invested in both the *place* and its *people*, I hope this website can be a constructive resource, rooted in balanced reporting and respect for local context.

I’ve also leveraged this project as a way for me to explore some *bleeding edge* web technologies that I have not used before — see the *README* on this websites [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fluffycheese/eaglequarter) for details on architecture, SEO strategy and automated, static deployment workflows (e.g., Astro, Cloudflare Pages, Git, n8n). I am also an advocate for online privacy and open source software — **all** the source code for this website is available on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fluffycheese/eaglequarter), I have made a concerted effort to collect as little data as possible and to create a transparent and readable [privacy policy](/src/content/pages/privacy.md).

Thank you for reading, and I welcome contributions, corrections, and community feedback as this journey continues.
