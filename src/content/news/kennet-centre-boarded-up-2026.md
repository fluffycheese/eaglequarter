The iconic Kennet Centre in Newbury has now been boarded up and secured as part of preparations ahead of its anticipated redevelopment, marking another visible milestone in the long and often contested evolution of the site’s future. This follows years of shifting planning proposals, public debate and council decisions concerning the future use of the large retail and leisure complex in the town centre. 

The closure and securing of the Kennet Centre structure — once a bustling heart of local retail — symbolises the end of an era for many residents and visitors who grew up with the centre as part of their shopping and social routines. While most current occupants have already left and boarded windows and entrances, the Vue cinema and several independent venues have remained open longer, even as the site prepares for transition.

## A Landmark Site Transitions to a New Phase

The centre’s boarding up comes as the broader **redevelopment narrative for the Kennet Centre continues to unfold**. Earlier proposals, including the controversial Eagle Quarter scheme, were dismissed by planning authorities and a government planning inspector on the grounds of scale and impact on the historic town centre conservation area.

More recently, revised plans branded as the “Old Town Newbury” proposal have gained traction with the local planning committee. These plans envision a mix of residential dwellings, commercial spaces and enhanced public areas that better relate to the historic character of the town centre, though not without raising debates about parking provision, affordable housing and pedestrian access.

Boarding up the building now signals that the site is moving out of the planning debate phase and closer to practical transition. Heavy plant and demolition fencing have been installed around the perimeter, with local contractors beginning preparatory site works ahead of more significant changes. 

## Mixed Feelings in the Community

Reaction has been mixed among residents and local business owners. Some see the boarding up as **closure of a familiar chapter** — especially for older generations who remember the centre’s peak years with shops, cafes and social spaces. For others, it represents **long-awaited progress** toward a vision of Newbury’s town centre that emphasises pedestrian links, housing and community spaces over a declining shopping mall. 

Local conservation groups, such as The Newbury Society, have previously emphasised the need for redevelopment that *respects historic character* and integrates sensitively with the wider townscape, rather than overwhelming it with high-rise blocks.

## What Happens Next

With the structure now boarded up and prepared for redevelopment, attention will turn to formal planning and construction phases of whichever scheme is finally adopted. The town council and West Berkshire planners have indicated forthcoming consultations with residents and businesses to refine proposals further and address community concerns, particularly around connectivity, footfall impact and integration with Newbury’s historic streets and public realm.
