The Government planning inspector has dismissed the appeal relating to the proposed Eagle Quarter redevelopment in Newbury town centre.

The decision follows concerns raised by West Berkshire Council regarding scale, massing, and the impact on the conservation area.

Further revisions are expected as developers reconsider the scheme.
