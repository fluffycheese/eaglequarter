The Kennet Shopping Centre in central Newbury — once a bustling retail hub complete with shiny floors, fish tanks and a vibrant mix of shops — closed its doors this month, ending decades of local history as retail patterns shifted and footfall declined.

Originally opened in the late 20th century, the centre hosted brands like Debenhams, New Look and TK Maxx, and served as an early workplace for many local residents. But the arrival of newer retail destinations — notably Parkway shopping centre in 2011 — saw shopper numbers dwindle, leaving a hollowed-out interior in its later years.

In recent years, independent ventures such as family-run Tiny Town and Boswells restaurant brought occasional life back into the space, showing there was community support for local businesses. However, these too are closing or relocating as the centre winds down ahead of redevelopment. 

Vue cinema, Nando’s and other established outlets are expected to remain open longer, even as the main structure prepares to make way for future mixed-use development plans. The closure marks not just a change in bricks and mortar, but the fading of a shared town-centre experience for many Newbury residents.
